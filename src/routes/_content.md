Svelte is a very interesting JavaScript framework.

Sapper, Svelte's official application framework, is also very interesting.

This site is playground to do experiments to see if Svelte & Sapper can be coerced into doing all the things that I expect out of a modern blog framework.

(I'm pretty sure it can.)
